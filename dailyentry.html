		  <br>I passed through Louisville, Kentucky in July and stopped to talk with Charley Schanck. He had just finished mowing his lawn and looked like he would do better on our physical readiness tests than some of our junior officers. During conversation with him, I found a man who had one of the remarkable careers that was so commonplace with the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the first half of the Twentieth Century. RADM Schanck began his career as a hand on a geodetic field party on July 9, 1924, and was commissioned as Aid with relative rank of ensign on February 5, 1927.

		  <br>On May 10 ,1992, Captain David Mullendore Whipp passed away. Captain Whipp was equally at home as an officer conducting his duties within the Coast and Geodetic Survey or among the first rank of that elite group of men who were the artillery surveyors of WWII. During the war, he earned the Silver Star Medal for gallantry in action, the Legion of Merit Medal for his contributions as an artillery surveyor, the Croix de Guerre for action with the Free French, and received other commendations. His unit, the First Field Artillery Observation Battalion, pioneered artillery survey methods and counter-battery sound and flash ranging techniques that were the foundation of artillery counter-battery firing operations. The celebrated Time on Target method of coordinating artillery fire of an entire Corps was made possible through the survey work of the field artillery observation battalions.

		  <br>Wonderful letters from you all yesterday. I am quite surprised that you enjoyed the tale of Osaka that much or that FIN* would want to print it! If I'd known that was going to happen, I would have been more detailed in many respects. For instance, one of the biggest hazards on those night raids is the "milling" 29's all over the sky. They really aren't milling, but so many get there at the same time, and go busting in over target-- and when you are going for a specific area at well over 200 mph-- it makes for a lot of sweating. Especially on that mission, because of the thick soup everyone was in fro the time they were over the coast and areas around target.

		  <br>At 4:00 p.m. on April 12, 1945, Miss Dorothy L. Taylor began a routine tour of duty at her station at Casper, Wyo. During the tour a heavy snowstorm isolated the station, precluding relief and resulting in a 28 hour shift for Miss Taylor. She nevertheless performed the station functions on schedule, including preparation of three consecutive 6-hourly maps, the taking and transmission of airway, 6-hourly, and pibal observations, and an unusually heavy telephone traffic. The 6-hourly observations and pibals were taken under considerable difficulty, with temperature ranging from 22° to 29° and winds from 25 to 50 miles per hour part of the time in heavy snow.

		  <br>I was born at home (all four of us were), at the farm at Barbers Corner on August 18, 1922, at six in the morning.  A nurse and a doctor came—Dr. Ludwig—but I was born before he got there!  My mother got a “hired girl” to help her take care of us for a few weeks.We lived on three farms when I was growing up.  My father grew corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, alfalfa, and hay for the animals.  We had six horses, two cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and sheep…  The Depression was hard on our family.  When I was twelve, in 1934, we lost our farm and had to move.  Everybody was poor then.  We had a phone when I was little, but not later—no electricity, no running water—and we were seven miles from town.  We had lamps and we would carry them to our rooms to study by.

		  <br>The Vietnam War was far more complex from the Vietnamese perspective than anything portrayed in the Western media. My father [pictured above with his American advisor] was a colonel in the South Vietnamese Army. He was educated at the French Catholic school Ecole Pellerin. The Japanese invasion of Vietnam in 1940 galvanized his generation’s political consciousness. Like many of his peers, he left school to join the Viet Minh, seeking independence from French colonial rule. He became a guerrilla fighter, living and hiding in remote areas to avoid capture by the French. When the country was divided in two, he chose to remain in the south while his younger brother and many of his friends went north.

		  <br>It was revealed after the war that my father’s driver for years was a Viet Minh sent to kill him, a mission that he failed to carry out several times because of his loyalty to my father. His previous driver had been killed in an assassination attempt on my father, which also took the lives of my uncle (my father’s youngest brother) and my cousin, while leaving him unscathed. This is just a small glimpse of the intricate web of human lives caught up in a complicated war, with conflicting familial and personal loyalties. The Vietnamese who fought on both sides of the war wanted the same thing for the country that they love, peace. It’s a picture that one never sees in the portrayal of the Vietnam War in the West.

		  <br>I was a US Navy Hospital Corpsman 3rd class stationed at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland. They asked some wounded vets to attend the signing of the New GI Bill on Aug 31. 1967. Corpsman always come with the Marines when they leave the hospital and I was pushing a wheelchair and wound up in the front row. I got one of the pens LBJ is handing out. One year later I was in Vietnam with the 2nd Bn ,1st Marines.

		  <br>My dad served a full tour, 1970-1971, approximately half of which was in and out of the DMZ [demilitarised zone] as his unit rotated through Khe Sanh. He received his draft card when he was 19 or 20, shortly after he left university to take care of a new baby (chances of being drafted were much higher if you were not a student). His brother tried to volunteer in his stead because of the baby, but that was not permitted, so my dad enlisted hoping to avoid deployment. You see, draftees were sent to boot camp and then usually straight to combat, but career guys they would train.My dad’s deployment happened the last year of his enlistment, his marriage did not survive his tour, and my uncle says he’s never been the same. I’m his first child by his second wife, I was born in 1976, and I’ve never met my older brother.

		  <br>In October of 1951, I guess it was the whole brigade moved west, because we’d been more central east for pretty much of that whole year. Except in the summer, we’d been over on the Han River defense line. Anyway, we moved west and as I say, our battalion positions were not that far away from Panmun Jom. And the night of the 10th, the enemy put in a big attack, a fairly big one, and the RCR [The Royal Canadian Regiment] were on our left and I think the Van Doos [a nickname for the Royal 22e Régiment] were on our right. And there was a lot of bullets flying and there was all kinds of stuff flying that night. And I took a bullet through my right lung. That was the end of Korea for me.
